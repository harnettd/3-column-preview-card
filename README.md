## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Sass
- BEM

### What I learned

I completed this project mainly to practice techniques I've learned working on previous projects. Also, I took the opportunity to implement some tips and tricks that I picked up from feedback on Frontend Mentor. Namely,

- I used the CSS trick `html {font-size: 66.7%}` to set `10rem` to `15px`.
- I set the card's width using `max-width: 100vw`. This is the first time I've used `vw` units.
- I set the preview card's height using `min-height: 100vh`. This is the first time I've used `vh` units.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
